<h2 class="sans">TALL TALES OF SPORT AND ADVENTURE.</h2>

<p class="title">I.&mdash;THE PINK HIPPOPOTAMUS. (continued.)</p>

<p>Far below lay the globe like a huge ball of glowing light, patched
here and there with dark tracts, and intersected with lines brighter
than the surrounding brightness. That was my goal. But here I was
still swiftly soaring from it. Oh, if I could but change my direction;
for such was the still unexhausted force of the momentum acquired by
the explosion that I knew I should not drop down for many a long day.
If I could only manage to speed diagonally down towards the earth, I
calculated that I could take advantage of the waves of the air to move
in a kind of switchback fashion towards the earth, and possibly, as I
neared the ground, I might either hook myself on to some tall tree or
plunge into a river or an ocean and save myself by my unequalled
powers of swimming. And here a sudden thought struck me. In life I had
respected the Ayah, but now she was dead and was far beyond the
possibility of feeling. I do not say of resenting, a discourteous
action. Time was slipping away; the earth was visibly diminishing; the
moment for action had come. Slowly and with determination I drew up my
right leg, and letting it out backwards with the force of a Nasmyth
hammer, delivered my foot full against the body of the Ayah.
Everything happened as I had anticipated. There was a dull and
melancholy thud as the lifeless body went off at its involuntary
tangent, while I flew sidelong and in a downward direction, my whole
course being changed by the impetus of the kick.</p>

<p>How long I flew like this I know not. At such a crisis moments are
centuries. After a time I re-opened my eyes and looked about me. Where
was I? Could it be? Yes&mdash;no&mdash;and yes again. All that I saw was
familiar. The towers, the cupolas, the domes, the minarets, the
battlements&mdash;all these I had seen before. Scarcely two hundred yards
below me lay the Diamond City from which I had that very night
ascended.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 430px;"><a href="images/109.png"><img src="images/109-430.png" width="430" height="472" alt="With a rush and a swoop I was upon him." /></a>
<p class="center">"With a rush and a swoop I was upon him."</p>
</div>

<p>I ought to explain that, as I had expected, partly owing to the
well-known laws of gravitation, partly owing to the celebrated
air-wave theory, first propounded by my friend, Dr.
<span class="smcap">Hasewitz</span>, Regius Professor of Phlebotomy in
the University of Bermuda, I was now proceeding in a series of
gigantic serpentine curves through the air. At the moment of which I
am speaking I was at the top of one of these curves, and I calculated
that, with luck, I should just be able, on my downward course, to
clear the western gate of the city, and then, having come to within a
few feet of the ground, I should speed upward again and onward heaven
knows whither. In a flash it occurred to me that if
<span class="smcap">Ganderdown</span> was ready at his appointed post
beyond the gate, I might in passing be able to seize him and bear him
with me in my wild flight. I pulled out my watch. The hands pointed to
five minutes past twelve, and as we had fixed midnight for our
meeting, I knew that my henchman, the very soul of punctuality, would
be at the rendezvous. Yes, there was the faithful old fellow, armed
and provisioned to the teeth, standing stolidly as was his custom,
apparently paying but little attention to anything that was going on
around and about him. With a rush and a swoop I was upon him. I
stretched out my hand, and, as I passed, took a full and powerful grip
of the collar of his coat, wrenched him from the ground, and thus
accompanied went serpentining onwards into the unknown.</p>

<p>I am bound to say that when his first surprise was over the old
warrior took it uncommonly well. His was never an inquisitive mind.
Like all who were brought into contact with me, he had an unswerving
faith in my genius. "If <span class="smcap">Wilbraham</span> says so,
it must be so, and there's an end of the matter," was one of his
commonest sayings, never more justified than on the occasion of which
I am now speaking.</p>

<p>"Have you the pemmican?" I asked him.&mdash;"I have."</p>

<p>"And the solidified beef-tea?"&mdash;"In my left pocket."</p>

<p>"And the combined boiler and cooking range?"</p>

<p>"Slung on my back."</p>

<p>"And the patent portable mule-cart with adjustable tram-lines?"</p>

<p>"Attached to my belt."&mdash;"And the&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>What I was going to say I cannot remember, for at this moment there
was a crash of glass, we both struck violently against some hard
surface, rebounded, fell, and lay perfectly still. In a minute or two
I recovered from the shock, and looked about me. <i>We were lying in
the manger of the Pink Hippopotamus!</i></p>

<h2>IRISH ASTRONOMY.</h2>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Sir Robert Ball</span>, recently delivering a
lecture (by request) under the above title, admitted that he did not
quite know what it meant, as he did not suppose Irish astronomy was
different from that of other nations. Isn't it be jabers? Judging by
parity of reasoning, we can imagine that Irish astronomy may be as
<i>sui generis</i> as are Irish politics. It is probably unusually
nebulous, and characterised by the revolution of suns round their
satellites, and the prevalence of excentric comets and shooting stars.
Had <span class="smcap">Addison</span> had it in mind, he would
probably have written his celebrated hymn somewhat as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem width21"><div class="stanza">
<p>The spaycious firmament on hoigh,</p>
<p>And all the green Hibernian skoy,</p>
<p>And wrangling hivens a foighting frame,</p>
<p>The reign of chaos do proclaim.</p>
<p>What though the "stars" do shoine&mdash;and squall,</p>
<p>And on each other's orbits fall!</p>
<p>What though no order, stable, sound,</p>
<p>Amidst those jarring sphayres be found!</p>
<p>Onraison there doth loud rejoice,</p>
<p>At hearing echoed her own voice;</p>
<p>For iver shouting as they shoine,</p>
<p>Our hiven's a Donnybrook divoine!</p>

<h2>THE ARCHITECT TO HIS WIFE.</h2>

<div class="poem width21">
<div class="stanza">
<p>I poetise seldom or never,</p>
<p class="i2">As a rule I am not such an ass;</p>
<p>I handle a metre scarce ever,</p>
<p class="i2">Unless it's connected with gas.</p>
<p>But once I was tempted to stray, dear,</p>
<p class="i2">In the realms of the Muses above,</p>
<p>And in somewhat professional way, dear,</p>
<p class="i2">To sing the delights of my love.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>I thought of you, sweet my <span class="smcap">Drusilla</span>,</p>
<p class="i2">As the daintiest lot in the land,</p>
<p>The prettiest fairy-like villa</p>
<p class="i2">That ever an architect planned.</p>
<p>You offered attractions unnumbered,</p>
<p class="i2">Your aspect was sunny and bright,</p>
<p>And my fancies ran wild, when I slumbered,</p>
<p class="i2">Depicting the charms of your site.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>I think I shall never forget, love,</p>
<p class="i2">How I called with an order to view;</p>
<p>You were empty, and still "To be Let," love,</p>
<p class="i2">And I was untenanted too.</p>
<p>I stocked you; I saw that we stood, love,</p>
<p class="i2">On mutually suitable spots,</p>
<p>And I swore I would do what I could, love,</p>
<p class="i2">To try to unite the two lots.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>I cautiously mooted the question,</p>
<p class="i2">And great was my rapture to find</p>
<p>That my timidly-ventured suggestion</p>
<p class="i2">Was not quite averse to your mind.</p>
<p>I therefore grew bold and took heart, love,</p>
<p class="i2">The business was promptly despatched,</p>
<p>We no longer stood coldly apart, love,</p>
<p class="i2">For lo, we were closely attached.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>'Tis long since this happened, and now, love,</p>
<p class="i2">Folk see us so happily matched,</p>
<p>They are ready to promise and vow, love,</p>
<p class="i2">We never were semi-detached.</p>
<p>Two beings were never so blended,</p>
<p class="i2">They say we could never be twain&mdash;</p>
<p>Well, so let it be, till life's ended,</p>
<p class="i2">And one let us ever remain!</p>

<p><i>Galloping Squire</i> (<i>pounding along</i>). Pouf! Pretty heavy
going! This country doesn't seem to be what it was when I was younger,
and rayther a lighter weight, in old Huntsman
<span class="smcap">Billy's</span> days. <i>Laudator temporis
acti?</i> Well, perhaps so&mdash;perhaps so. Still, neither meets nor
mounts strike me as being quite up to the old form. Some of our new
men have the manners of a cheeky young chawbacon on a gate. That hard
rider from the Midlands, for instance! Most of our new mounts lack the
blood and pace of the horses of old times. This weedy Welsh crock for
example! "Kim up, ye hugly brute!" as <span class="smcap">John
Leech's</span> huntsman put it. Ah! when Old
<span class="smcap">Will</span> took us across the Stone-Wall Country
in '69 and '70, hunting <i>was</i> hunting, horses <i>were</i>
horses&mdash;yes, and gentlemen of the hunt <i>were</i> gentlemen! Now,
what with mixed fields, cocktail crocks, and false scents, the sport's
no longer a sport for&mdash;persons of Plantagenet descent and patrician
instincts.</p>

<p>However, <i>Taffy</i> answers gamely enough to spur and whipcord.
Considering my weight and&mdash;well, other difficulties, the weedy-looking
nag, is going fairly well. Fancy he'll hold out to the crest of the
hill yonder, where I think I see <span class="smcap">Jack
Morley</span> with my second mount. Kim up! Yes, there's
<span class="smcap">Jack</span>, with the Irish horse he thinks so
much of, and takes such pains with. Humph! Bit tired of Irish mounts
myself, though mustn't mention it to <span class="smcap">Jack</span>.
'Twas Irish horses brought Old <span class="smcap">Billy</span> his
biggest croppers after all, though <i>he</i>, too, was wondrous sweet
on 'em. Prefer a mount from the stable of the Predominant Partner,
myself, if I <i>might</i> have my choice&mdash;which I mustn't&mdash;worse luck!
Good old <i>Budget</i> strain <i>my</i> fancy! Not over fast, perhaps,
but first-rate weight-carriers, and always in at the death&mdash;or the
Death Duties, as I might say, if on a Derby platform instead of a
Welsh pigskin. Ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p>Yes, <i>Taffy</i> will hold on to the top of the hill&mdash;(First
Reading Point)&mdash;and then for a "quick-change" to the Irish horse. If I
don't lose time, and have ordinary luck, the two will carry me
through, ridden alternately.</p>

<p><i>Irish Groom</i> (<i>meditating</i>). Ah, here comes the Guv'nor,
pounding away on <i>Taffy</i>. Glad to catch sight o' me and
<i>Paddy</i>, I'll warrant. He's taken about the last ounce out o' the
Welsh'un, if I'm any judge. Rides a bit lumpy, the Guv'nor does,
nowadays, though his pluck's as good as ever, I must say. Well, we're
ready for him, the Irish horse and me, fit as a fiddle, and groomed to
a hair, though I say it as shouldn't, p'raps. Come along, my new
incarnation of good old <span class="smcap">Whyte-Melville's</span>
"Galloping Squire." (<i>Sings.</i>)</p>

<div class="poem width24">
<div class="stanza">
<p>The Galloping Squire to the saddle has got,</p>
<p class="i2">That saddle a heavier weight has ne'er borne;</p>
<p>From his stable he's drafted the pick of his lot,</p>
<p class="i2">(Two nags by his enemies held in foul scorn,)</p>
<p>One Welsh, t'other Irish; both likely to tire.</p>

<p class="i2">The cramped ones he'll creep, and the fair ones he'll
fly.</p>
<p>It's a <i>mighty</i> queer place that will put in the mire</p>
<p>That artful old horseman, our Galloping Squire.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>A fast forty minutes of run and of race,</p>
<p class="i2">And he's glad of a change, as indeed are we all.</p>
<p>The two he must ride are not gluttons for pace,</p>

<i>may</i> not fall,</p>
<p>His second mount's here. He may puff and perspire,</p>
<p>But he's game to go on, is our Galloping Squire!</p>
</div></div>

<p><i>Galloping Squire</i> (<i>coming up and preparing to change
mounts</i>). Pouf! Oh! here you are, <span class="smcap">Jack</span>!
Sharp's the word! Quick change, and on we go again! The Welsh horse
has carried me better than I expected, though I've had to bustle him
along, and he's a bit blown.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Changes mounts smartly.</i></p>

<p><i>Irish Groom.</i> That's right, Squire. The Welsh 'un hasn't done
so badly, but I think you'll find the Irish 'un fit as a fiddle. These
Irish horses&mdash;&mdash;Ah! <i>he</i>'s off. (<i>Looking after him, as he
takes the bridle of Taffy.</i>) Well, he'll do <i>his</i> best, beaten
or not, blowed if he won't! Goes well, too, he does, for an old 'un!
Hope <i>Paddy</i>'ll pull him through to the end o' the run.

<h2 class="sans">THE INTERVIEWER'S VADE MECUM.</h2>

<p><i>Question.</i> What is the object of an interviewer?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> To show the merit of his work at the expense of the
interviewed.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Is there any choice in selecting a subject?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Very little, all that is necessary is that the name at
the head of the article shall be fairly familiar to the general
reader.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Need the interviewer record the history of the
interviewed?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> No; unless matter grows short and the exploits of the
hero are required for padding.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> But have not those exploits made the hero famous?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Yes, and consequently they have become "old matter." To
be interesting, details, if frivolous, must be up to date.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Which would be the better copy&mdash;an account of the
subject's most successful campaign, or a description of his
wardrobe?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Undoubtedly the latter. The exploits will certainly have
been described a score of times, but a list of coats, hats and
neckties will probably have the charm of novelty.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Then you would not value your subject's diary?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Not if it merely recorded his public life. In such a case
it would be distinctly less interesting than his butcher's book.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Are the surroundings of a hero of moment?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Certainly, if they are little known. The back yard of the
greatest poet becomes a spot full of interest if it has hitherto
escaped description.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Then a poet's staircase is more memorable than his
stanzas?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Certainly; and the warrior's umbrella-stand than the
record of his battles&mdash;a philosopher's overcoat than the tale of his
scientific discoveries.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> If the interviewed has a dog or a cat, is it advisable to
refer to the fact?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Assuredly, and such a reference should run to the length
of half a dozen pages, and possibly a couple of illustrations.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> But surely the interviewed must sacrifice a fair amount
of time to the interviewer?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Quite so; but the obligation is mutual.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> And yet it is only the interviewer gets a reward?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> In money. But then the interviewed has his
advertisement.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Is such an advertisement very valuable?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> If the account is published at the commencement of the
season it may convert the subject into a Society lion.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> And what are the advantages enjoyed by such a
creature?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Invitations to dinners, dances, and at homes, from
all-but-perfect strangers&mdash;for a while.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> And what follow?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Reaction and forgetfulness.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> It seems that to be interviewed is not permanently
beneficial to the subject?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Of course not; but that is a matter of small importance
to the interviewer.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Then what advantage does the latter obtain at the cost of
the former?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> That is a question that can best be answered by reference
to the ledgers of the publishers.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Why should not the interviewed turn the tables upon their
visitors and become the interviewers?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Because an interviewer is seldom of sufficient importance
to undergo the operation.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Is there any other reason?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Certainly; and a most important one. If the interviewer
became the interviewed, from the latter's point of view it wouldn't
pay.</p>

<p>Since it first lifted its tall head, "like a bully," as
<span class="smcap">Pope</span> rudely put it, the London Monument has
been much looked at. If it is not to be superseded amid the sights of
London, it is time it began to look out for itself. A rival has been
creeping up year after year in the bulky volume known as <i>Burdett's
Official Intelligence</i>. The volume just out bears the record
Fourteenth Year&mdash;a mere child in point of age, but a prodigy of
colossal size and almost, supernatural knowledge. It is perhaps quite
an accident that the pages run up to 1899. But the fact is fresh
testimony to the <i>fin de si&egrave;cle</i> character of the work.
Persons about to marry would, my Baronite says, find it a nice start
in the way of furnishing a library. In emergency, it would serve as a
dining-table, a footstool, a four-post bedstead, or (if the pages were
cut out and distributed as tracts in the City) the binding might be
rebuilt to form a spare bedroom. Just the book to take down with you
to Brighton, or up the river on some of those sunny days we hope are
coming. Crammed full of information from cover to cover. What
<i>Burdett's Intelligence</i> does not know about financial affairs
and Stock Exchange business would make a very small book.</p>

<h2>ADVERTISEMENT EXTRAORDINARY.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>To the Editor of "Punch."</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;We think it our duty to call your
attention to the appearance of a book that otherwise would have
possibly entirely escaped your attention. It is called <i>A Neglected
Incident in a Company's Career</i>. It is written by a gentleman with
a name of historical importance, and contains, amongst other inviting
matter, several letters from the author to his illustrious ancestor.
It is full of the most interesting stories, although its accuracy is
scarcely unimpeachable. As some of the tales are not entirely
laudatory of the Company with which we had the honour once to be
connected, we beg to lay our case before you.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 120px;"><a href="images/113-2.png"><img src="images/113-2-120.png" width="120" height="204" alt="To the Editor of 'Punch.'" /></a>
</div>

<p>We have approached the writer of the book, and asked him to
withdraw it. We have not obtained a satisfactory answer. We have also
appealed to the publisher of the book (whose name we would give in
full if we did not think that you might editorially suppress it, as
there is a column set apart in another portion of your issue for book
advertisements), and he, too, has not seen his way to rendering us any
assistance. He has referred us to the author, who still leaves us
without a remedy.</p>

<p>However, the publisher (with whom we cannot absolutely agree) makes
a suggestion which seems to us in every way admirable. As it is our
wish to cause <i>A Neglected Incident in a Company's Career</i> to be
as little circulated as possible, he proposes that we should write a
joint letter to all the leading London papers, setting forth the
highly interesting character of its contents. This we are now doing,
as you will see from this communication.</p>

<p>Yours truly,</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;It is unnecessary to state, after the above ingenious
explanation and gratuitous advertisement, that it is highly probable
that <i>A Neglected Incident in a Company's Career</i>, once possibly
little read, may now be obtained at every respectable circulating
library in town or the country.</p>

Nothen doin' just now&mdash;nothen 't all!</p>

<p><i>Third Farmer</i> (<i>enviously</i>). Well, <i>you</i> hevn't no

arf as furrard, I know thet!</p>

<p><i>F. Fretwail.</i> Ah, them "Keep yer 'air on"'s, <i>you</i> mean,
<span class="smcap">Ryemouth</span>. I don't deny as they was lookin'
tidy enough a week back. But just as I was makin' ready fur to paint
up "Try it on a Billiard Ball," blamed if this yere frost didn't set
in, and now theer's everything at a standstill wi' the brushes froze
'ard in the pots!</p>

<p><i>F. Ryemouth.</i> 'Tis the same down with me. Theer's a acre o'
"Bunyan's Easy Boots" as must hev a noo coat, and I cann't get nothen
done to 'en till th' weather's a bit more hopen like. Don' keer
<i>'ow</i> soon we hev a change, myself, I don't!</p>

<p><i>F. Lackaday.</i> Nor yet me, so long as we don't 'ave no gales
with it. Theer was my height-acre pasture as I planted only las'
Candlemas wi' "Roopy's Lung Tonics"&mdash;wunnerful fine and tall they was,
too&mdash;and ivery one on 'en blowed down the next week!</p>

<p><i>F. Fretwail.</i> Well, I 'ope theer wun't be no rain, neither,
come to that. I know I 'ad all the P's of my "Piffler's Persuasive
Pillules" fresh gold-leaved at Michaelmas, and it come on wet directly
arter I done it, and reg'lar washed the gilt out o' sight an'
knowledge, it did. Theer ain't no standin' up agen rain!</p>

<p><i>F. Ryemouth.</i> I dunno as I wouldn't as lief hev rain as sun.
My "Hanti-Freckle Salves" all blistered up and peeled afoor the summer
was 'ardly begun a'most.</p>

<p><i>F. Lackaday.</i> 'Tis a turr'ble 'ard climate to make 'ead
against, is ourn. I've 'eard tell as some farmers are takin' to they
enamelled hiron affairs, same as they used to hev when I wur a lad. I
mind theer wur a crop o' "Read Comic Cagmag" as lingered on years
arter the paper itself. Not as I hold with enamelling, myself&mdash;'tain't
what I call 'igh farmin'&mdash;takes too much outer the land in <i>my</i>
'pinion.</p>

<p><i>F. Fretwail.</i> Aye, aye. "Rotation o' boards." Say, "Spooner's
Sulphur Syrup" fur a spring crop, follered with some kind o' soap or
candles, and p'raps cough lozengers, or hembrocation, or bakin'
powder, if the soil will bear it, arterwards&mdash;that's the system
<i>I</i> wur reared on, and theer ain't no better, 'pend upon it!</p>

<p><i>F. Ryemouth.</i> I tell 'ee what 'tis; it's time we 'ad some
protection agen these yere furrin advartisements. I was travellin'
along the Great Northern tother day, and I see theer was two or three
o' them French boards nigh in ivery field, a downright shame an'
disgrace I call it, disfigurin' the look o' the country and makin' it
that ontidy&mdash;let alone drivin' honest British boards off the land.
Goverment ought to put a stop to it; that's what <i>I</i> say!</p>

</div>

<p><i>F. Lackaday.</i> They Parliment chaps don't keer <i>what</i>
becomes of us poor farmers, they don't. Look at last General Election
time. They might ha' given our boards a turn; but not they. Most o'
they candidates did all their 'tisin' with rubbishy flags and
balloons&mdash;made in Japan, Sir, every blamed one o' them! And they
wonder British Agriculture don't prosper more!</p>

<p><i>F. Ryemouth.</i> Speakin' o' queer ways o' hadvertisin', hev any
on ye set eyes on that farm o' young
<span class="smcap">Fullacrank's</span>? Danged if iver <i>I</i> see
sech tomfool notions as he's took up with in all <i>my</i> born

<p><i>F. Fretwail.</i> Why, what hev he bin up to <i>now</i>, eh?</p>

<p><i>F. Ryemouth.</i> Well, I thought I shud ha' bust myself larfin'
when I see it fust. Theer ain't not a board nor a sky sign; no, nor
yet a 'oarding, on the 'ole of his land!</p>

<p><i>F. Lackaday.</i> Then how do he expect to get a profit out of
it?&mdash;that's what <i>I</i> want to year.</p>

<p><i>F. Ryemouth.</i> You'll 'ardly credit it, neighbours, but he's
been buryin' some o' they furrin grains, hoats and barley, an' I dunno
what not, in little 'oles about his fields, so as to make the words,
"Use <span class="smcap">Faddler's</span> Non-farinaceous Food"&mdash;and
the best on it is the darned young fool expecks as 'ow it'll all
sprout come next Aperl&mdash;he do indeed, friends!</p>

<p><i>F. Fretwail.</i> Flyin' in the face o' Providence, I calls it.
He must ha' gone clean out of his senses!</p>

<p><i>F. Lackaday.</i> Stark starin' mad. I never heerd tell o' such

newspaper reader, but I flatter myself on being a fair Shakspearian
student. Judge my delight, then, Sir, on seeing that "Pistols Bill"
was recently the subject of parliamentary discussion. I "read no more
that day," but, satisfied with the heading, at once write to you to
know if "Falstaff's Bill" (with the small item of "bread" in it) will
next come under discussion? I am, indeed, rejoiced to find that our
British Parliament has now before it a subject worthy of
consideration.</p>

<h2 class="sans">ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<p class="title1">EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</p>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday Night, February 25.</i>&mdash;Glasgae
setting its house in order. Local authorities have drafted Bill
regulating domestic institutions. One of a class that come regularly
to Westminster. House knows nothing of particulars, but is final
arbiter. This Bill, like many others of same kind, would have passed
without notice, if lynx eye of <span class="smcap">Jemmy
Lowther</span> had not chanced to fall upon it. Horrified to discover
its many infringements of personal liberty. Glasgae bailies well known
for what <span class="smcap">Asquith</span> would call their "almost
convulsive" purity. Only the other day they sternly repressed artistic
enterprise whose development was unaccompanied by what they regard as
adequacy of clothing. In this Bill they leave nothing untouched.</p>

<p>Happily, whustling on the Sabbath is a crime long ago stamped out
on the banks of the Clyde. But there are other habits indigenous to
headlong youth which Glasgae is determined to put down. Boys have been
known, for example, unlawfully to run behind a tramcar, following up
the vehicle with felonious intent of obtaining a free ride, probably
in the opposite way they were going when they met the conveyance, and
were attracted by the opportunity furnished by the conductor
collecting fares on the roof. They would be well advised, after the
Glasgae Corporation Police Bill is passed, to forego that delirious
delight. As <span class="smcap">Cross</span>, apologetically
presenting himself as Glasgae citizen and Glasgae Member, put it, if
the Bill passed, no cat could catch a mouse, no dog might worry a rat
in Glasgae, without being subject to a penalty of forty shillings. A
similar fine awaits a man upon conviction of having exposed to public
view a leg of mutton, unless it be decently draped.</p>

<p>Effect of Bill upon <span class="smcap">Caldwell</span> a little
painful to Members sitting near him. Lashed himself into appalling
fury. Desiring, with national economic instinct, to make one effort
simultaneously serve two purposes, he pitched his voice in a key upon
which, whilst ostensibly addressed to
<span class="smcap">Speaker</span> in Chair, it might be heard in
Glasgae. Something weird-looking about
<span class="smcap">Caldwell</span> when he thus from his seat in
House of Commons whispers in ear of constituents in far-off Lanark.
The startled stranger crossing Palace Yard and hearing the voice grow
more thundrous as he advances, pictures to himself a man in a towering
rage. Reaching House he will find upright behind Treasury Bench a man
decently dressed in black, without the slightest flash of expression
on his face, roaring with volume of sound that would cause to blush
any stray bull of Bashan meditatively making its way down Sauciehall
Street, pricking up its ears at the reverberation brought northward
across the timorous Tweed.</p>

<p>As <span class="smcap">Cawmel-Bannerman</span>, suffering on the
bench below, observed, "It really doesn't seem fair that a man should,
with perfectly placid face and mien, continuously roar in this
fashion. If he were in Glasgae under this Police Bill, he would
immediately be wrapped up in a decent cloth and fined forty
shillings."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Asquith</span> moves for
leave to bring in Welsh Disestablishment Bill. "Sheer political cant
of the most nauseous kind," was
<span class="smcap">Hicks-Beach's</span> genial description of
<span class="smcap">Home Secretary's</span> argument.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;"The world," said
<span class="smcap">Chesney</span>, speaking just now in debate on
<span class="smcap">Everett's</span> motion, "is divided into two
classes, people who understand the subject, and people who do not. The
former are all bimetallist, the latter are gradually going over."</p>

<p>I fancy I must be going over; certainly I don't understand the
subject. Thankful, therefore, for opportunity to hear
<span class="smcap">Everett</span> discourse on it. A tall,
grave-looking man, with a touch of sadness suggestive of long brooding
over bimetallic theories. In fullness of design to instruct House,
went back all the way to <span class="smcap">Julius
C&aelig;sar</span>. Finally arrived in Garden of Eden; recalled fact
that originally, in time of primeval peace and prosperity, two people
walked in it. This principle of duality ran through everything. "There
are, for example," said <span class="smcap">Everett</span>, swinging
his pince-nez between finger and thumb in convincing manner, "white
corn and red corn, white grapes and black grapes." ("White sand and
grey sand," hummed <span class="smcap">Wilfrid Lawson</span>, waking
up out of sleep.) "Nature has given to each of us two eyes for the
common purpose of sight, two ears to hear withal, two hands and two
legs." ("What about the Isle of Man?" asked
<span class="smcap">Rochfort Maguire</span>. "Understand they have
three legs there.")</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg 120]</span></p>

<p>"We are created in two sexes," <span class="smcap">Everett</span>
continued, half closing his eyes and paying no attention to the voice
of the scorner; "whose highest purpose is fulfilled only when they are
married."</p>

<p>Here he opened his eyes and glanced significantly at
<span class="smcap">Maguire</span>.
<span class="smcap">Rochfort</span> blushed. Wished he hadn't
interfered.</p>

<p>These arguments, new in controversy of long standing, proved
surprisingly conclusive. <span class="smcap">Squire of Malwood</span>
spoke for hour and a half, vehemently declaring that he would have
nothing to do with bimetallism, would not touch it with a pair of
tongs.</p>

<p>"Sorry to interrupt the right hon. gentleman," said
<span class="smcap">Everett</span>; "but he has just alluded to
another instance of the infinitude of the principle of duality. Did
any hon. Member ever see a tong? No, always a pair. <i>Toujours</i>
two, as the French say."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Squire</span> finished up by announcing he
would accept <span class="smcap">Everett</span>'s amendment, though
most careful to protest that it really meant nothing, least of all
approval of the heresy of bimetallism.</p>

<p>"You may say what you please," said
<span class="smcap">Courtney</span>; "so long as you take our
resolution."</p>

<p>Then the bimetallists jubilantly went home arm in arm.</p>

<p>"Arm in arm, of course," said <span class="smcap">Everett</span>,
driving off in a pair-wheeled hansom. "Still another illustration of
the irresistible, illimitable principle of duality. Wish, by the way,
I'd mentioned when on the subject that the result of marriage is
occasionally twins. One of those things&mdash;or should I say two of those
things?&mdash;a fellow always thinks of on the staircase."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Squire of
Malwood</span>, swearing he would ne'er consent to bimetallism,
consented to adopt resolution put forward by bimetallists.</p>

<p><i>Friday</i>, 2 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>&mdash;Few people know,
even suspect, what takes place here when we have a "nicht wi' Burns,"
or rather an early morning. Not known, because few Southerners remain
to witness orgie: no English paper reports it. According to beneficent
Standing Order, ordinary debate stands adjourned at midnight. Members
go home, whether work in hand accomplished or not. One curious
exception to rule. Scotch Members, accustomed to get a little more for
their money than other sections of community, managed to carry
amendment whereby matters relating to educational affairs North of the
Tweed may be discussed all night if necessary. Accordingly, from time
to time, when ordinary business of sitting wound up, Scotch Members
clan together and make a night of it.</p>

<p>Happened just now. At midnight Welsh Disestablishment Bill brought
in; Members troop off leaving what <span class="smcap">Jokim</span>
irreverently calls "a Pict selection of Scots." Business on hand
related to Universities (Scotland) Act, 1889. So it appears on Order.
First business actually is to bring in the haggis.
<span class="smcap">Macfarlane</span> told off for this duty, because
he's only member who, being resident in London, has his kilt handy.
Also there is a subtle, inexpressed feeling that his flowing beard
(when it can be kept out of the haggis-dish) gives a bardic appearance
to ceremony. Dr. <span class="smcap">Farquharson</span> preceeds him
with bagpipes, which seemed to-night to have just a slight touch of
influenza. <span class="smcap">Caldwell</span> brews a peck o' maut;
"Cald without" they call it, in spite of the rising steam and the
stirred-up sugar. But a Scotchman, as <span class="smcap">Donald
Currie</span> admits, is not to be done out of a joke on account of a
few awkward details in the way of matters of fact. No pipes are
allowed except those in <span class="smcap">Fahquharson's</span>
hands, but they manage to face deprivation, and have, on the whole, a
merry evening. Joining hands round table, on which lay the astonished
Mace, we sang "<i>Auld Lang Syne</i>" just now, and so home to
bed.</p>

<p>Don't quite know what became of the Universities (Scotland) Act,
1889. Fancy we repealed it. <i>Business done</i> (<i>earlier in
sitting</i>).&mdash;Welsh Disestablishment Bill brought in.</p>

<p><i>Friday, Midnight.</i>&mdash;Best day's work since Session opened. At
morning sitting <span class="smcap">Asquith</span> moved for leave to
bring in two important measures, and got it. If things go on at this
rate <span class="smcap">Home Secretary</span> will soon be known as
<span class="smcap">Ask-with-Success</span>. At night useful
discussion on Post Office contract with Telephone Company. When
<span class="smcap">Sage of Queen Anne's Gate</span> interposed
everybody thought he was going to show that all the evil dilated upon
came from having <span class="smcap">Premier</span> in the House of
Lords. Didn't even mention <span class="smcap">Rosebery</span>, unless
he meant to include him in condemnation of "financiers and other
disreputable persons."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Bills brought in to Amend Factories and
Workshop Act and Truck Acts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pure Beverages.</span>&mdash;What is cocoa? I write
to ask because our grocer says it has just been legally decided that
a mixture containing eighty per cent. of flour and sago, and the rest
genuine nibs, deserves to be called by that name. Is this really the
law? He also tells me that in the Navy our sailors quite enjoy a cocoa
that is half composed of "foreign fats." If so, is our Admiralty
justified in getting its fat from abroad instead of supporting home
industries? And when Jack Tar asks for cocoa, ought not he to get it?
At all events, I have decided to pay my grocer's next bill with eighty
per cent. of French pennies, and see how he likes
<i>that!</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Soul of Honour.</span></p>
